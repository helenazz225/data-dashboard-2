## Web Development Project 6 - *Data Dashboard-2*

Submitted by: **Helena Zhang**

This web app: **Retrieves recipes from a public API. It retrieves a default numbver of 25 recipes and displays an image, the name, and the ID, and displays a graph showing the relationship between the index of a retrieved recipe and its ID number. The user can search the retrieved dataset by title or ID, and can filter the information retrieved from the database based on the diet or cuisine. Also, when clicking on any recipe title, the user will be routed to a page containing more detailed info about the recipe (larger image, title, id, link that recipe is from, health score, and whether or not its vegetarian)**
